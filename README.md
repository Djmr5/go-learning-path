## Introduction

The Go programming language is an open source project developed by a team at Google and many contributors from the open source community. Go is statically typed, compiled, and syntactically similar to C, with the added benefits of memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency.

The contents of this repository aim to be a series of tutorials and personal learning notes on Go programming language to help me understand the language and its features. Also, I hope this repository can be useful for anyone who wants to learn Go.

## Go

### Basics & Getting Started

To start programming in Go, you need to install the Go compiler. You can download the Go compiler from the [official website](https://go.dev/dl/). After installing the Go compiler, you can check if the installation was successful by running the following command:

```bash
go version
```

To better understand the Go basics, you can look at the README.md file in the [basics folder](basics/README.md).
